# Aptoide Challenge - Ricardo Santos

This application uses:

    1. AngularJS 4.4.6
    
    2. [ng-file-upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload)
    
    3. [Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/)
    
This frontend is able to load one or more images by clicking the upload area or by dragging a number of images to that same area.

Images can be taken out by clicking the 'x' button.

There are two small animations. One on the arrows and the the 'x' delete button.


The two arrows when clicked move the scrollable section by 300px.

## Setup

### Setup Angular ( Frontend )
